InstaScanner is essentially a small program which allows a user to generate sound through the act of scanning an 
image and other small interactions. The colours of the pixels of the image and the way the image is scanned 
all have an effect on the notes being generated by the program. The goal of the program is to generate a curiosity 
within the user with regards to visual, audio, and computer programming arts.
