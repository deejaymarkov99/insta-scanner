InstaScanner is essentially a small program which allows a user to generate sound through the act of scanning an 
image and other small interactions. The colours of the pixels of the image and the way the image is scanned 
all have an effect on the notes being generated by the program. The goal of the program is to generate a curiosity 
within the user with regards to visual, audio, and computer programming arts.

This repo contains the source and library code from an xcode project made on osx. Go to https://www.juce.com/ for information on how to run JUCE C++ code. If you do not want to go through with the hastle of setting up JUCE do not hesitate to contact me directly and I can send you a working executable.

Groundwork complete, full functionality still in progress. Note if you do decide to run the code/get the eecutable from note that the resizing of images does not work yet, so all images uploaded must be jpgs of size 440x440 pixels.
